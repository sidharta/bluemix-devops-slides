# Bluemix DevOps Services

These are the slides for my presentation about "Bluemix DevOps Services". In this presentation I try to show a little bit more of the powerful services inside Bluemix related to DevOps, for instance:

- Git and Source Code
- Live Edit and Debug
- Autoscaling and High Availability
- Delivery Pipeline
- Blue / Green Deployment

## Build from source

You can build this slides from Markdown source. For that, the following frameworks were used:

- [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)
- [reveal-ck](https://github.com/jedcn/reveal-ck)

With reveal-ck installed, you can run this command to generate the slides:

```
> reveal-ck generate
```

And the following to present the slides:

```
> reveal-ck serve
```
